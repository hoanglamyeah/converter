                            <p>A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by
                                convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of
                                quantity. Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of
                                measurement.</p>
                            <p>Different systems of units have different choices of base units. Base units (or
                                fundamental units) are subsets of units where no subset quantity can be expressed in
                                terms of the others. In the International System (SI) of Units, there are seven base
                                units: kilogram, metre, candela, second, ampere, kelvin, and mole.</p>
